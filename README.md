# Arcade in command shell
This was just a fun mini project which was created while learning linux. It is a bash script which can be used in both Windows and Linux OS command shells. 
The folder >gamingcodes< contains some complex python codes for classic games (All the game codes have been outsourced).
Saving the code files in home directory and running the bash script in command shell would result in running the desired games.
